# Extended-Euclidean-algorithm-GCD
The aim of this project is to implement the Extended Euclidean algorithm,
which is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm, that computes in addition to the greatest common divisor gcd(a,b) of integers a and b, 
also the coefficients (s and t) of a and b, such that:

**gcd(𝑎, 𝑏) = 𝑠𝑎 + 𝑡𝑏**, 

gcd(a,b) can be expressed as a Liner Combinaiton with integer coefficients of a and b. For example:

gcd(6, 14) = 2, and 2 = **(−2)** ⋅ 6 + **1** ⋅ 14
